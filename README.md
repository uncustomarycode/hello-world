Hello, world!

I'm Kelly. I'm an introverted feminist bookworm with a raging caffeine addiction and an insatiable curiosity.
I've decided to take on coding because it involves less real-life contact with people while holding space for creativity.
Ideally, I'd like to make this into a career. Drinking coffee and being in front of a computer for work is pretty much the dream.
It's rad that there's always something new to learn with code. 
Yo ho yo ho a programmer's life for me
